# Deployment Fixes - Missing Assets

## Issues Fixed (Date: Current)

### 1. Missing Logo in Navigation
**Problem:** Logo was not showing in the navbar on production
**Solution:** 
- Copied logo from `/lovable-uploads/` to `/public/images/logos/prometheus-logo.png`
- Updated Navbar component to use the new path: `/images/logos/prometheus-logo.png`
- This path is more standard and reliable for production deployments

### 2. Missing Favicon
**Problem:** Favicon was showing the default Vite icon
**Solution:**
- Updated `index.html` to reference `/favicon.ico` instead of `/vite.svg`
- The favicon.ico file already exists in the public directory

### 3. Missing Partner Logos in "Our Experience Is Proven" Section
**Problem:** Partner logos were not loading from Supabase storage
**Solution:**
- Added fallback partner logos array in `AboutPartners.tsx`
- Modified the component to use fallback logos when:
  - Supabase returns no data
  - Supabase connection fails
  - There's an error fetching logos
- Fallback logos use the existing `/logo-placeholder.svg` with partner names

## Verification Steps
1. Check that the Prometheus logo appears in the navigation bar
2. Verify the favicon shows in the browser tab
3. Confirm partner logos appear in the "Our Experience Is Proven" section
4. Test on both staging (.io) and production (.co) domains

## Future Improvements
- Add actual partner logo images to `/public/images/partners/`
- Configure Supabase storage bucket permissions for production
- Consider using a CDN for static assets
